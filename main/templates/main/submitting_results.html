    <h3>Submitting results</h3>
    <h4>Strava Users</h4>
    <p>
        The easiest way to access this site is with a Strava account which is a member of the
        <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/romsey-road-runners">Romsey Road Runners Strava Club</a>. These accounts
        will automatically capture race results from Strava, and will be immediately activated.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>First</strong> make sure you're a member of the Strava Club and <i>then</i> click "Connect with Strava"
        on the <a href="{% url 'account_login' %}">Sign In page</a>. This will allow us to automatically capture your
        times from Strava if the activity has a privacy setting of <i>"Followers Only"</i> or <i>"Everyone"</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure your race attempts include <i>"Club Challenge Road"</i> in the title for road races or
        <i>"Club Challenge Trail"</i> for trail.
    </p>
    <p>
        We only capture activities which are within a reasonable margin of error (-50m +100m) of the actual course
        distance (<a href="{% url 'race_list' %}">the race pages</a>). If your activity is too long
        <a href="https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216919437-Crop-Tool-for-Activities">
        here's how to crop activities</a>. If it is too short due to GPS problems, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:results@romseyroadrunners.co.uk">results@romseyroadrunners.co.uk</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usually activities will be captured from Strava immediately but this can take up to two hours. If it meets the
        requirements above but isn't showing up, try slightly editing the title on Strava which will trigger an update.
    </p>
    <h4>Non-Strava Users</h4>
    <p>
        Please register using the "Manual Registration" button on the <a href="{% url 'account_login' %}">Sign In page</a> and
        enter all your details. You will need to wait for us to check you are a club member and activate your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will then be able to use the "Submit Result" button above to manually upload evidence of your results.
        Ideally this should be a GPX file which you can export from most watches/services. However we will accept a
        photo of your watch (or equivalent) showing time and distance.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are not comfortable signing up for this site, you can email
        <a href="mailto:results@romseyroadrunners.co.uk">results@romseyroadrunners.co.uk</a> with your time and evidence
        and we will upload it for you.
