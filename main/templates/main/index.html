    <h3>Welcome to the Romsey Road Runners Club Challenge 2022!</h3>
    <p>The details are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Follows on from 2021's Virtual Race Series</li>
        <li>Free to all members</li>
        <li>Trail and road options available for each distance</li>
        <li>Choose whether you do road, trail or both</li>
        <li>One distance is open per month (see <a href="{% url 'race_list' %}">Races</a>)
            <ul>
            <li>January - 5k</li>
            <li>February - 5 mile</li>
            <li>March - 10k</li>
            <li>April - 10 mile</li>
            <li>May - Half marathon</li>
             </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Run as many times as you like during that month. Only your fastest time for each race will show on the
            leaderboard, but as Road and Trail are counted as separate races you can enter times for both and they will
            both be counted.</li>
        <li>We will accept Strava activities, GPX files, a photo of your watch (or equivalent) showing time and distance
            as evidence of your result</li>
        <li>The winners are the fastest female and male runners for each distance and type
            (eg fastest road 5k, fastest trail 5k) and the best age-graded male and female runner for each distance and
            type</li>
        <li>None of the routes are marked; please use the maps and GPX files provided on this site to follow the route.
            Please make sure you start and finish where the map indicates so weâ€™re all running the same route in the
            same way.</li>
        <li>Please don't pause your watch mid route; we need your best elapsed time not moving time to enter you into
            the results</li>
        <li>By taking part you are consenting for the organisers to use your date of birth to calculate your age-graded
            results. Only your age-graded results without any personal data will be published. If anyone would prefer
            not to be included in the age-graded results please let us know and we will accommodate this.</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Submitting results</h4>
    <h5>Strava Users</h5>
    <p>
        The easiest way to access this site is with a Strava account which is a member of the
        <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/romsey-road-runners">Romsey Road Runners Strava Club</a>. These accounts
        will automatically capture race results from Strava, and will be immediately activated.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>First</strong> make sure you're a member of the Strava Club and <i>then</i> click "Connect with Strava"
        on the <a href="{% url 'account_login' %}">Sign In page</a>. This will allow us to see any Public or Followers Only
        activities on your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure your race attempts include <i>Club Challenge Road</i> in the title for road races or <i>Club Challenge Trail</i>
        for trail, exceed the race distance but are no more than 100m over
        (<a href="https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216919437-Crop-Tool-for-Activities">here's how to crop activities</a>).
    </p>
    <h5>Non-Strava Users</h5>
    <p>
        Please register using the "Manual Registration" button on the <a href="{% url 'account_login' %}">Sign In page</a> and
        enter all your details. You will need to wait for us to check you are a club member and activate your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will then be able to use the "Submit Result" button above to manually upload evidence of your results.
        Ideally this should be a GPX file which you can export from most watches/services. However we will accept a
        photo of your watch (or equivalent) showing time and distance.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are not comfortable signing up for this site, you can email
        <a href="mailto:results@romseyroadrunners.co.uk">results@romseyroadrunners.co.uk</a> with your time and evidence
        and we will upload it for you.
