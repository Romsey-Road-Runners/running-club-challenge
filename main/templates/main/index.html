    <h3>Welcome to the Romsey Road Runners Club Challenge 2022!</h3>
    <p>The details are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Follows on from 2021's Virtual Race Series</li>
        <li>Free to all members</li>
        <li>Trail and road options available for each distance</li>
        <li>Choose whether you do road, trail or both</li>
        <li>One distance is open per month (see <a href="{% url 'race_list' %}">Races</a>)
            <ul>
            <li>January - 5k</li>
            <li>February - 5 mile</li>
            <li>March - 10k</li>
            <li>April - 10 mile</li>
            <li>May - Half marathon</li>
             </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Run as many times as you like during that month. Only your fastest time for each race will show on the
            leaderboard, but as Road and Trail are counted as separate races you can enter times for both and they will
            both be counted.</li>
        <li>We will accept Strava activities, GPX files, a photo of your watch (or equivalent) showing time and distance
            as evidence of your result</li>
        <li>The winners are the fastest female and male runners for each distance and type
            (eg fastest road 5k, fastest trail 5k) and the best age-graded male and female runner for each distance and
            type</li>
        <li>None of the routes are marked; please use the maps and GPX files provided on
            <a href="{% url 'race_list' %}">the race pages</a> to follow the route. Please make sure you start and
            finish where the downloadable map indicates so weâ€™re all running the same route in the same way.</li>
        <li>Actual course distances often do not exactly match the race distance. The race pages have a good estimate of
            the actual distance, but please use the marked start and finish times on the downloadable map.</li>
        <li>Please don't pause your watch mid route; we need your best elapsed time not moving time to enter you into
            the results</li>
        <li>By taking part you are consenting for the organisers to use your date of birth to calculate your age-graded
            results. Only your age-graded results without any personal data will be published. If anyone would prefer
            not to be included in the age-graded results please let us know and we will accommodate this.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your results can be automatically captured from Strava if you Sign Up with the "Connect with Strava" option.
            However other options for submitting results are available.
        </li>
