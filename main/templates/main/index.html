        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Submitting results</h4>
    <h5>Strava Users</h5>
    <p>
        The easiest way to access this site is with a Strava account which is a member of the
        <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/romsey-road-runners">Romsey Road Runners Strava Club</a>. These accounts
        will automatically capture race results from Strava, and will be immediately activated.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>First</strong> make sure you're a member of the Strava Club and <i>then</i> click "Connect with Strava"
        on the <a href="/accounts/login">Sign In page</a>. This will allow us to see any Public or Followers Only
        activities on your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure your race attempts include "Club Challenge" in the title, have a "Type of Run" of "Race", are within
        the start and end date of the event, exceed the race distance but are no more than 100m over
        (<a href="https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216919437-Crop-Tool-for-Activities">here's how to crop activities</a>).
    </p>
    <h5>Non-Strava Users</h5>
    <p>
        Please register using the "Manual Registration" button on the <a href="/accounts/login">Sign In page</a> and
        enter all your details. You will need to wait for us to check you are a club member and activate your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will then be able to use the "Submit Result" button above to manually upload evidence of your results.
        Ideally this should be a GPX file which you can export from most watches/services. However we will accept a
        photo of your watch (or equivalent) showing time and distance.
    </p>
